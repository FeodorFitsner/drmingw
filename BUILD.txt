This file has instructions on how to build DrMingw from source.


Dependencies:

* MinGW
* CMake
* BFD (optional)


I always build DrMinGW from Linux with MinGW cross compilation toolchain.  See
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CmakeMingw for details.  It should be possible to
build with a native MinGW toolchain, though I haven't tried.



BFD headers are not typically included in native/cross MinGW distributions.
Binaries are but they too have several undesired dependencies.  So the best
approach is to build BFD from source.

These are roughly the steps (again, assuming a cross-compilation MinGW
toolchain):

  wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.23.2.tar.bz2
  tar -xjf binutils-2.23.2.tar.bz2
  cd binutils-2.23.2
  ./configure --host i686-w64-mingw32 --disable-nls --prefix=/
  make
  make install DESTDIR=$PWD/publish
